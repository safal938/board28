            "hpi": "The patient is reviewed on Day 3 of her hospital admission following severe DILI. Methotrexate was stopped immediately upon recognizing it as the causative agent. Sarah remains significantly jaundiced; however, nausea has shown slight improvement since admission. Vital neurological signs include a stable Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15, with no evidence of hepatic encephalopathy (HE); absence of asterixis or cognitive impairment. The ALT level, though elevated at 420 U/L, is beginning to decline, suggesting a positive response to the cessation of Methotrexate. Crucially, the INR remains stable at 1.1, indicating preserved liver synthetic function. These clinical findings collectively confirm a diagnosis of severe, cholestatic DILI in a patient with underlying Metabolic Associated Steatotic Hepatitis (MASH), markedly susceptible to hepatotoxic insults.",

Anthropometrics: Weight 81 kg (BMI 30.1 kg/m\u00b2). No significant interval weight change since admission.",

GCS remains a reassuring 15 with negative neurological signs including asterixis, tremor, and speech abnormalities. Cardio/Pulmonary: Vital signs are stable with no indications of fluid overload, pulmonary distress, or hepatorenal syndrome. Abdominal Examination: The abdomen is soft and non-tender. The liver edge is not easily palpable due to Sarah's body habitus, yet no tenderness is detected upon examination."
