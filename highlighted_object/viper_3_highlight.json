Stevens, MD, MRCGP\n**Date:** 2024-05-06\n**Linked Encounter:** Outpatient Review \u2013 Pre-DMARD Evaluation\n**Source:** VIPER Clinical Decision Support Engine\n\n---\n\n### **V \u2013 Verification of Clinical Data**\n\n* Reviewed full laboratory panel from 2024-05-06:\n\n  * **ALT 35 U/L (normal)**\n  * **AST 30 U/L (normal)**\n  * **ALP 102 U/L (normal)**\n  * **Bilirubin normal**\n  * **INR normal**\n* Reviewed all chronic hepatitis screening results:\n\n  * **HBsAg negative, HBcAb negative, HCV Ab negative**\n* Reviewed autoimmune screen:\n\n  * **ANA negative, ASMA negative, LKM-1 negative, IgG normal**\n* Reviewed metabolic panel:\n\n  * **Ferritin normal, transferrin saturation normal, A1AT normal**\n* Reviewed Fib-4 Index: **0.9 (low risk)**\n* Confirmed no hepatotoxic concomitant medications apart from intermittent NSAID use, now minimised.\n\n---\n\n### **I \u2013 Interpretation of Risk**\n\n* **All reversible causes of transaminitis previously present have resolved.**\n* Hepatocellular injury noted in Encounter 1 is confirmed as **transient MASLD flare**, not chronic liver disease.\n* Negative viral, autoimmune, and metabolic screen eliminates major contraindications to MTX.\n* Current liver function is **stable and low-risk** for MTX initiation.\n* MASLD remains a background risk factor, but risk is mitigated by:\n\n  * recent weight-loss efforts\n  * improved diet\n  * reduced alcohol use\n* Overall risk classification: **Low\u2013Moderate**, acceptable for MTX with strict monitoring.\n\n---\n\n### **P \u2013 Planning**\n\n* Approve **Methotrexate initiation at 7.5 mg once weekly**, start date **2024-06-03**.\n* Prescribe **Folic Acid 5 mg weekly**, 24h post-dose.\n* Implement a **strict 6-weekly LFT + FBC monitoring protocol**:\n\n  * 1st scheduled test: **2024-07-15**\n  * Auto-alerts configured for:\n\n    * ALT > 2\u00d7 ULN\n    * Platelets < 150 \u00d7 10\u2079/L\n    * Neutrophils < 1.5 \u00d7 10\u2079/L\n\n---\n\n### **E \u2013 Escalation & Safety Netting**\n\n* Safety-net advice provided:\n\n  * Stop MTX immediately and contact clinic if **jaundice, dark urine, severe fatigue, vomiting**, or RUQ pain develop.\n  * Avoid NSAIDs unless absolutely required; paracetamol preferred.\n  * Abstain from alcohol entirely during first 6 weeks.\n* Discussed MASLD contribution and the need for ongoing lifestyle improvement.\n* No current indication for hepatology referral.\n* Escalation trigger: persistent ALT > 1.5\u00d7 ULN at any follow-up.\n\n---\n\n### **R \u2013 Recommendations (Final VIPER Output)**\n\n\u201cFollowing full review of all laboratory, clinical, and risk-stratification data, the patient is **safe to commence Methotrexate** under a structured monitoring schedule. No evidence of chronic liver disease or absolute contraindication. Continue MASLD lifestyle management. LFTs must be followed rigorously every 6 weeks. Patient educated on red-flag symptoms and agrees to the plan.\u201d\n\n---\n",
