This information is typically found in a patient's master patient index or demographic record.\n\n### Determine correct category code for radiology (LP29684-5)\n*   **Category Code:** `LP29684-5` is identified as the correct LOINC code for radiology reports. This code is used in the FHIR API query.\n\n### Set modality filters for CT and MRI\n*   **Modality Filters:** The query should include filters for `http://dicom.nema.org/resources/ontology/DCM|CT` and `http://dicom.nema.org/resources/ontology/DCM|MRI`.\n\n### Set status filter to 'final'\n*   **Status Filter:** The query should specify `status=final` to retrieve only finalized radiology reports.\n\n### Apply date filter (e.g., 'ge2015-01-01')\n*   **Date Filter:** The query should include `date=ge2015-01-01` to retrieve reports from January 1, 2015, onwards.\n\n### Set sorting to newest first and limit results\n*   **Sorting:** The query should use `_sort=-date` to sort results by date in descending order (newest first).\n*   **Limit:** The query should use `_count=5` to limit the results to the 5 most recent reports.\n\n### Verify authentication token\n*   **Authentication Token:** Verification of the authentication token is required before executing the API request. This step is external to the provided patient data.\n\n## Task: Execute HTTP request with patient UUID\n\n*   **Action:** Execute the provided `curl` command using the identified parameters.\n*   **Note:** The `<UUID>` placeholder must be replaced with Sarah Miller's actual patient UUID. The `curl` command as provided:\n    bash\n    curl -X GET 'https://api.bedfordshirehospitals.nhs.uk/fhir-prd/r4/DiagnosticReport?patient=<UUID>&category=http://loinc.org|LP29684-5&date=ge2015-01-01&modality=http://dicom.nema.org/resources/ontology/DCM|CT&modality=http://dicom.nema.org/resources/ontology/DCM|MRI&status=final&_sort=-date&_count=5'\n    \n\n### Check HTTP status code for success\n*   **Requirement:** Monitor the HTTP status code returned by the API request. A `200 OK` status code indicates success.\n\n### Validate response JSON structure for DiagnosticReport entries\n*   **Requirement:** Parse the JSON response and validate that it contains `DiagnosticReport` entries with expected fields such as `code`, `subject`, `effectiveDateTime`, `conclusionCode`, and `presentedForm`.\n\n---\n**Audit Summary:**\nReviewed the `todo` object for radiology data retrieval for Sarah Miller. Extracted specific parameters for API query based on the provided sub-tasks. Identified missing patient UUID and external authentication requirement. The structured output provides the necessary parameters for executing the retrieval task. Data reviewed spans from 2015-01-01 to the present, based on the specified date filter. No radiology reports were found within the provided patient encounter data.",
